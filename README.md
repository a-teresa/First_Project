## First_Project: what languages will last forever?

## I - Instalation:
#### No necessary libraries beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## II - Files: 
#### - 1 notebook available; 
#### - all the files (16) that correspond to 2011 - 2021 datasets(11): [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

## III - Motivation: For this first project I was intersted in finding the answer for 3 main questions, 
looking through the stackoverflow survey results - multiple years (2011 - 2021):
#### 1 - What are the most popular programming languages?
#### 2 - What are the programming languages that people most want to learn?
#### 3 - Is there a relationship between the quantity of programming languages a developer knows and higher salaries?

## IV  - Contents in the notebook:
#### 1 - Business Understanding
#### 2 - Data Understanding
#### 2.1 - Looking at the data
#### i) size of datasets
#### ii) Columns that have no missing values (in each dataframe)
#### iii) Columns that have the most missing values (more than 80 %)¶
#### iv) First glance: select main columns of interest; making some questions...

## 3 - Data Preparation.
#### Gathering and wrangling:
- Popular Languages: 2016
- Popular Languages: 2017
- Popular Languages: 2018
- Popular Languages: 2019
- Popular Languages: 2020
- Popular Languages: 2021
#### Some sorted questions.
#### The more programming languages you know the higher your salary?¶
### 4 - Modeling the data. ¶
#### Predicting salary: selected year (2020)
### 5 - Results
